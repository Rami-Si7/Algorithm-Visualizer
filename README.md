# Algorithm-Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive Python project that uses Pygame to visualize popular sorting and graph traversal algorithms. Users can input custom graphs and see how algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traverse them. Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort are also available for visualization.

## Features
Sorting Algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
Graph Algorithms:
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Depth-First Search (DFS)
  
Custom Graph Input:
* Users can input custom nodes and edges, and the nodes will be splattered randomly across the screen for visualization.
* Prevents duplicate nodes and edges.
* Allows users to define as many edges as possible based on the number of nodes.
* Visually appealing "splatter" effect to spread nodes across the screen.
  
Predefined Graphs:
* Option to visualize graph algorithms on a predefined graph.

## Installation:
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Pygame: Pygame is required to run the visualizer. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:
* pip install pygame


## Cloning the Repository
* git clone https://github.com/Rami-Si7/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
cd algorithm-visualizer

## How to Run
* python main.py

## Usage

### Sorting Algorithms
1. From the main menu, choose "Sorting Algorithms".
2. Select one of the sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort.
3. Choose whether to enter data manually or have random data generated for you.
4. Watch the algorithm visualize the sorting process.
   
### Graph Algorithms
1. From the main menu, choose "Graph Algorithms".
2. Select one of the graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).
3. Choose whether to use a custom graph or a predefined graph.
4. Custom Graph: Enter nodes and edges manually. The nodes will be splattered across the screen for visual appeal.

### Predefined Graph:
1. A default graph will be used.
2. Watch as the algorithm traverses the graph.
