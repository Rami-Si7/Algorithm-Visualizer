# Algorithm-Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive Python project that uses Pygame to visualize popular sorting and graph traversal algorithms. Users can input custom graphs and see how algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traverse them. Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort are also available for visualization.

## Features
Sorting Algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
Graph Algorithms:
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Depth-First Search (DFS)
Custom Graph Input:
* Users can input custom nodes and edges, and the nodes will be splattered randomly across the screen for visualization.
* Prevents duplicate nodes and edges.
* Allows users to define as many edges as possible based on the number of nodes.
* Visually appealing "splatter" effect to spread nodes across the screen.
Predefined Graphs:
* Option to visualize graph algorithms on a predefined graph.
